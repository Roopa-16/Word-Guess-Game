# Word-Guess-Game

## Purpose?
Create a game where the user guesses the word by letters. It counts the amount of times you have guessed alonged with the right/wrong guesses.


### Project Goals:
1.) create a list of words to guess 
2.) somehow find a way to loop the words and randomize the words
3.) make an array with the number of letters in the word and list out spaces to the user
4.) use the document.upkey to get a letter from the user and fill it into the array if correct and if it is wrong then put it off to the side of the screen under letters incorrectly guessed. 
5.) also loop the number of guesses the user has and display the number of guessed the user has 
6.) display wins and losses at the bottom of the screen and display a new word.
